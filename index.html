        <p>"We must deal with her, most carefully and diplomatically. We must be courteous, polite and diplomatic to win her to our side‚Äù reads a Portuguese record of 1591 C.E. 
            this was the realization of the Portuguese after a very bad defeat they suffered at the hands of Chennabhairadevi,
             the Queen of Gersoppa.</p>
       <p> Now a small town on the northern banks of Sharavati River in North Kanara district of Karnataka State,
        Gersoppa (a.k.a Gerusoppa) was the capital of Salva kings. </p>
       <p>The land was known as Haive, which was ruled by Salva dynasty for more than two centuries.
        Earlier Gersoppa was known as Nagar Bastikeri, or just Ngaire.</p>
       <p>A big center of trade and commerce, the city was famous for beautiful temples, basadis and as a place of literary and cultural activities.
        Honnavar (a.k.a Honavar) was under the control of the Salvas.</p> 
        <p>It was a big harbor of interior trade and Bhatkal was a big international trade seaport. 
        Quality horses and weaponry were imported from West and landed at Bhatkal.</p>
       <p>Pepper and other spices were exported by shiploads to Middle East and European countries through Bhatkal port.</p>
       <p>Many wars were fought for the control of Honavar and Bhatkal ports by Vijaynagar, Adilshah and Keladi kings.
        They tried to keep Salva kings in good humour and Salvas made their presence felt throughout. 
        They were at times in charge of Tuluva (South Kanara) country as well.</p>
        <p>Chennabhairadevi belonged to Tuluva-Salva lineage wherein the ruler or a noble was succeeded by his sister's son or "aliyasantana" a custom that prevailed in Kerala and Tuluva or south Kanara.</p>
